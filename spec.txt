Phone Store Inventory Spec

I would like to help phone stores manage inventory accurately.
I believe the first step is to have reliable data.
I therefore seek to record all phones available in a store, including their brand, model, and current stock information.

Each phone belongs to a brand and has a specific model.
Phones are tracked to ensure pricing, stock quantity, and purchase dates follow business rules.
